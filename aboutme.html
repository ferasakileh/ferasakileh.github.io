      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p style="font-size: medium; margin-bottom: -50px;">At The Ohio State University, I am majoring in Computer Science Engineering with a focus in Software Engineering. My choice to pursue this track is fueled by my goal to make the computing industry a more diverse space as well as my passion for software development. People from all different backgrounds use technology everyday and I believe the creators of the technology should reflect the people that use it. 

Along with studying at Ohio State, I am also involved in a service fraternity, Alpha Phi Omega (Alpha Iota Chapter) that enriches the local and campus community through leadership, fellowship, and service events. I have served as the inclusion chair for this organization, allowing our members to learn more about the cultures that uplift our university every day. 

I would love to communicate, please reach out to me via email at akileh.3@osu.edu</p>
