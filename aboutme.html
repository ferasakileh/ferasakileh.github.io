      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p style="font-size: medium; margin-bottom: -50px;">Hi, I’m Feras Akileh, a passionate software developer and rising senior at The Ohio State University, majoring in Computer Science Engineering with a focus on Software Engineering. My journey into technology started with building a website for a pediatric cancer awareness charity I founded, an experience that revealed how powerful and meaningful technology can be when used to create real-world impact.

Since then, I’ve developed expertise in full-stack development, cybersecurity, SEO, and ADA compliance, driven by a commitment to building secure, accessible, and high-performance web solutions. I have conducted over 50 Checkmarx SAST scans to enhance application security and performed 30+ accessibility audits using SortSite to ensure inclusive design. Whether developing applications for the Ohio Department of Insurance, optimizing SEO for hackathon platforms, or automating workflows to save hours of manual effort, my goal remains constant, create digital experiences that are safe, accessible, and valuable to all users.

At Ohio State, I’m also dedicated to fostering diversity and inclusion within the tech industry and my community. As membership inclusion chair for Alpha Phi Omega (Alpha Iota Chapter), a service fraternity committed to leadership, fellowship, and service, I help our members engage with and celebrate the diverse cultures that enrich our campus.

I believe technology should reflect the diverse world it serves, and I’m excited to contribute to a more inclusive, innovative computing industry. Feel free to reach out to me at akileh.3@osu.edu — I’d love to connect!</p>
